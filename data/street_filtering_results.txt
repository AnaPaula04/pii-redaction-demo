Street Name Filtering Test Results
===================================

PROBLEM: 
In v2, "State St" was over-masked:
Input:  "Meet me at 1200 N State St, Chicago, IL"
Output: "Meet me at 1200 N [LOC_REDACTED], [LOC_REDACTED], [LOC_REDACTED]"

SOLUTION:
Added --filter-streets flag in v3 to filter common street terms.

Common street words filtered:
- street, st, avenue, ave, road, rd
- boulevard, blvd, lane, ln, drive, dr
- way, court, ct, place, pl, circle, cir
- parkway, pkwy, highway, hwy

RESULT WITH --filter-streets:
Input:  "Meet me at 1200 N State St, Chicago, IL"
Output: "Meet me at 1200 N State St, [LOC_REDACTED], [LOC_REDACTED]"

IMPROVEMENT:
✅ "State St" no longer masked (more readable)
✅ "Chicago" still masked (correct - city is location)
✅ "IL" still masked (correct - state is location)

IMPACT:
- Reduces false positives for street names
- Improves readability while maintaining privacy
- User can choose: use flag for better readability, or don't use it for maximum privacy

RECOMMENDATION:
Use --filter-streets when:
- Addresses are common in your data
- Readability is important
- Full street addresses aren't considered PII

Don't use --filter-streets when:
- Maximum privacy is needed
- Even street names should be hidden
- Dealing with sensitive location data
